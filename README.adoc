= IHO Metanorma Templates

This GitHub repository contains templates for IHO documents.

This repository is used by the `metanorma new` command to create new documents.

== Document types

These types supported in this template repository:

* `s-100`: The template belongs to the S-100 series and is based on the rules given in IHO S-97: IHO Guidelines for Creating S-100 Product Specifications
* `default`: The template belongs to the default for IHO, extrapolated from C-17

Note that both of these generate `standard` documents for their document type ("doctype") by default, but they are still invoked through
the `-d` option.
