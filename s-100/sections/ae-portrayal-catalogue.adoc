A Product Specification has several components â€“ typically a main document that provides
the human-readable documentation; and machine-readable files for information such as the Feature
Catalogue and Portrayal Catalogue.

Portrayal is an optional part of a Product Specification. However, if consistent portrayal across all user
platforms is important to an S-100-based data product, then specifying how portrayal is done becomes
mandatory. Within S-100 Product Specifications, this is done by including a Portrayal Catalogue. The
Portrayal Catalogue is a collection of defined portrayal instructions for a Feature Catalogue; and includes
portrayal functions, symbols and portrayal context.

Portrayal Catalogues are machine-readable instructions for how to portray data compliant with a specific
data model for a specific version of a Product Specification. They can either be constructed manually or by
a Portrayal Catalogue Builder (PCB). In either case, they must comply with the structure specified in S-100
Part 9 and the S-100 Portrayal Catalogue Schema. The IHO infrastructure includes a PCB for XSLT for any
Product Specification development team wishing to utilize it in the creation of a Portrayal Catalogue for an
S-100-based Product Specification.

Not every Specification will need a Portrayal Catalogue -- this should be
determined as part of the development
process and stakeholder feedback.
