Generally, data created from an S-100-based Product Specification will not remain valid indefinitely.
Therefore, it is necessary to specify how data created in accordance with a Product Specification will be
maintained, including the updating of datasets and support files.

== Data Maintenance

=== Maintenance and update frequency
Datasets are maintained by replacement on a dataset basis. That is, the entire data product and the associated metadata are replaced as a unit. This is unlike vector data that may be updated incrementally. However, coverage data must be considered as a unit. Also, each replacement data set must have its own digital signature.

=== Data source
Data producers must use applicable sources to maintain and update data and provide a brief description of the sources that were used to produce the dataset.

=== Production process
Data Producers should follow their established production processes for maintaining and updating datasets.
