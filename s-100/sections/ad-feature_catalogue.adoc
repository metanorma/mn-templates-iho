ISO 19110 defines a Feature Catalogue as a catalogue that contains definitions and descriptions of the
feature types, feature attributes and feature associations occurring in one or more sets of geographic data.
Therefore, the Feature Catalogue acts as a machine-readable representation of the Application Schema,
and gives a system the means to describe the elements of a dataset that conforms to the Feature
Catalogue.
