The Product Specification should contain all information at a sufficient level of detail for easy
implementation by the intended stakeholders. However, there may be additional considerations that
impact implementers, users and other stakeholders. These additional considerations can be added to a
section or appendix called an Implementation Guide, or another appropriate title. Such a section can be
used to give context of intended use, or used to elaborate on special circumstances that impact
stakeholders, and so forth.
