The dataset identification section uniquely identifies any dataset as being created in accordance with
a specific Product Specification series.

Different from the general information about the data product, the dataset identification is for the
individual dataset. 

Some Product Specifications have merged the informal description of the data product with the dataset
identification section, into a common section (as shown below). This is an allowed option.

(S-97 A-6.2.4)

TODO: S-102 conflates data product description with dataset identification; need exemplar where that does not happen.
